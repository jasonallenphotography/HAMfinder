<h1>Welcome to HAM Finder!</h1>

<p>HAM Finder is a web application developed by <a href="https://github.com/jasonallenphotography">Jason Allen</a>, a student at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>.</p>

<p>This appliction allows users to save locations by zipcode relevant to their home location or travels, query all of the 2m and 70cm band repeaters within 25 miles of the target zipcode, and receive a CSV file that is ready to load into a HAM Radio programming appliction (I recommend and contribute to <a href="http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp">CHIRP</a>).</p>

<p>My hope is that this web application will make it easier for amateur radio enthusiasts, Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) groups, and Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES) groups to program their digital radios.</p>
